# Morphir Runtime

## FFI - Foreign Function Interface

> NOTE: This feature is a work in progress!

The Morphir runtime provides a Foreign Function Interface (FFI) that allows you to call functions written in other languages from within Morphir. This is useful when you need to interact with existing libraries or services that are not written in Morphir.

```scala
val linker = Linker()
```
